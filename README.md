Color Theme Disintegrator

## Description


## Purpose and usage

1. Input RGB/HSL/HSV colors from someone's palette
2. Pick a focus color
3. Calculate the RGB/HSL/HSV deltas for all other palette members from focus
4. Possibly use Isotope to dynamically add elements for unlimited color combos
5. Start learning how to use ReactJS on this?

## TODO

- [X] Create a fixed number of palette picker widgets
    - Must show RGB, HSV, HSL version of colors
    - Color picker widget must dynamically update color swatch in card
    - Swatches autopopulate on page load
- [X] Re-theme Spectre.CSS buttons
- [X] Show color value deltas from first color in cards
- [x] Put color calculations in a grid so they're more readable
- [ ] Enable dynamic numbers of palette widgets
    - Might use React for this
- [ ] Enable selection of focus color
