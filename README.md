Color Theme Disintegrator

## Description


## Development plan

1. Input RGB/HSL/HSV colors from someone's palette
2. Pick a focus color
3. Calculate the RGB/HSL/HSV deltas for all other palette members from focus
4. Possibly use Isotope to dynamically add elements for unlimited color combos
5. Start learning how to use ReactJS on this?


- Possible Javascript libraries for color pickers:
